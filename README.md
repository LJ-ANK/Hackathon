# **Alternative Credit Evaluation Tool for Farmers.**
### Fintech project

Traditional credit evaluation methods often fail to capture the unique challenges and opportunities faced by farmers. Factors such as land quality, weather patterns, and crop yield potential play a significant role in determining a farmer's creditworthiness. Your challenge is to design an Alternative Credit Evaluation Tool that incorporates non-traditional data sources such as live GIS (Geographic Information System) data, upcoming weather forecasts, soil health metrics, etc., to create a more inclusive credit scoring system for farming loans. The tool should help financial institutions assess risk more accurately and enable farmers to access fair and tailored credit options.

## **Key Features:**

**Data Integration:** Utilize live GIS data, weather forecasts, soil health metrics, and past crop yields.

**Financial Risk Assessment:** Provide a transparent and explainable scoring system that financial institutions can trust.

**User Accessibility:** Ensure the tool is usable by banks, NBFCs, and farmers with minimal technical knowledge.

**Scalability & Adaptability:** Design the tool to work across different regions with diverse farming conditions.

**Regulatory Compliance:** Ensure adherence to financial regulations and data privacy laws.
